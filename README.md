## Project idea

This project came to my mind when I was trying to follow a workout but had trouble keeping track of the time spent, the current exercise and the number of repetitions.
<br>
This web-app intention is to solve that problem in a fast way: by just pasting (with the correct format) the workout you want to do.
Unlike other already available apps, there is no need to mess with the GUI in order to describe what your intervals look like.
It allows you to set up almost instantly and also it allows you to focus your valuable time and energy in the workout.


## Project future

This project is not fully finished (and probably will never). Due to the huge potential for this type of app.

You can see a list of the future ideas and improvements in the [Project Section](https://github.com/t1emp0/workout-timer/projects/1), as well as all the past development.
